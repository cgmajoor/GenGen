# GenGen

### Description
GenGen is a multi-purpose custom text generator app for iPhone. Now also using OpenAI API.

You can use it to:
- Brainstorm
- Create text-based content
- Lorem ipsum placeholder text
- Generate password
- Name your iguana, cat or the dragon in your next best seller
- Find a motto to your next billion dollar company, start-up, music band
- Funny phrases and jokes
  
It combines the concepts you feed it, adds the element of randomness and then AI magic. 

Demonstrating a modern, scalable, and testable architecture built using SOLID principles, clean architecture and protocol-oriented programming in Swift using UIKit. 
This project is designed to showcase best practices in iOS development, with modular components, reusable patterns, and a clear separation of concerns.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into distinct folders to support modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each folder and component adheres to a specific responsibility, following the principles of Clean Architecture and SOLID:

- **Configuration**: Contains environment configurations and initial project settings for a streamlined and adaptable app configuration.
- **GenGen**: The core module encapsulating all app logic, data, and UI components, organized as follows:
  - **App**: Entry point and environment setup with key components like `AppRouter`, `AppDelegate`, `Environment`, `AppConfig`, `AppTheme`, `Texts`, and `AppDependencies`.
  - **UseCases**: Business logic and application-specific rules organized as single-responsibility use cases, supporting testability, readability, and maintainability.
  - **GGData**: Contains data models, utilities, and CoreData integration.
  - **Modules**: Encapsulates individual feature modules with a focus on modularization and separation of concerns.
      - **Loading**: Manages initial app loading and preloading data states.
      - **Main**: Sets up the main interface and primary navigation structure.
      - **Onboarding**: Manages the user onboarding experience.
      - **Generator**: Core feature for generating and customizing content.
      - **Library**: Manages the library with books.
      - **Book**: Handles book-related features and its content management.
      - **Rules**: Provides content rules and restrictions management.
      - **RuleCreator**: Allows dynamic rule creation and management.
      - **Favorites**: Stores and manages user favorites.
   - **CustomViews**: Reusable and custom UI elements, enhancing modularity and ease of UI customization.
   - **Utility**: Shared utilities and helper functions that support the overall functionality of the app.
   - **Extensions**: Swift extensions used throughout the app, adhering to DRY principles and enhancing standard functionality.
